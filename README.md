## Description
This application is designed to simplify the process of writing a ReadMe file. It walks the user through a series of command line prompts and takes those user generated responses to automatically generate a ReadMe file formatted with the proper markdown syntax. This will allow the user to spend more of their time working on projects and code without sacrificing a quality and professional ReadMe.
